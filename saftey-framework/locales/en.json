This framework builds on the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/hierarchy-of-controls/about/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-100 font-medium underline hover:text-zinc-600 dark:hover:text-zinc-300\">Hierarchy of Controls</a> to give a clear answer. Think of it like <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/ip-ratings\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-100 font-medium underline hover:text-zinc-600 dark:hover:text-zinc-300\">IP ratings</a>, but for how well a device protects its users.",
  "intro_p2": "Take the Petzl GriGri, a climbing device designed to grip the rope automatically when a climber falls.
