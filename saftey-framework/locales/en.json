  "meta_description": "A framework for classifying how effectively safety has been designed into a device. Rate devices from 0 (no protection) to 5 (inherently safe).",
  "og_description": "A framework for classifying how effectively safety has been designed into a device. Like IP ratings, but for safety.",
  "subtitle": "A framework for classifying how effectively safety has been designed into a device.",
  "intro_p1": "How safe is a device, really? And how much does it depend on the person using it? This framework builds on the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/hierarchy-of-controls/about/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-100 font-medium underline hover:text-zinc-600 dark:hover:text-zinc-300\">Hierarchy of Controls</a> to give a clear answer. Think of it like <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/ip-ratings\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-100 font-medium underline hover:text-zinc-600 dark:hover:text-zinc-300\">IP ratings</a>, but for how well a device protects its users.",
  "intro_p2": "Take the Petzl GriGri, a climbing device designed to grip the rope automatically when a climber falls. Many assume it will lock automatically, but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBGkKqLhM8Y\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-100 font-medium underline hover:text-zinc-600 dark:hover:text-zinc-300\">catastrophic failures</a> can occur when operators overestimate a device's safety level.",
  "how_to_use_label": "How to use:",
  "how_to_use": "Rate the device based on its primary hazard under normal operating conditions. Focus on what the device does to protect the operator, not edge cases or deliberate tampering.",
  "scale_least": "Least effective",
  "scale_most": "Most effective",
  "examples_label": "Examples",
  "level_0_name": "No Protection",
  "level_0_description": "The device offers no protective features. The hazard is fully exposed and no skill or technique can make it safe.",
  "level_0_example_1": "A vintage bench grinder with no wheel guards, no eye shields, and no spark arrestors. The spinning abrasive wheel is fully exposed during operation.",
  "level_0_example_2": "An open fire pit. The flames and heat are exposed during use.",
  "level_1_name": "Safe Only With Correct Use",
  "level_1_description": "The device provides no engineering controls to help the operator. Safety relies entirely on user skill, procedures and PPE.",
  "level_1_example_1": "A basic chainsaw. Safety depends entirely on operator technique, stance, and PPE (chaps, helmet, gloves).",
  "level_1_example_2": "A tube-style belay device. The device has no automatic braking. Safety depends entirely on the belayer maintaining proper grip and technique.",
  "level_2_name": "Safety Encouraged",
  "level_2_description": "The device provides cues, markings or warnings to encourage correct behaviour, but does not block unsafe use.",
  "level_2_example_1": "An extension ladder with angle indicators, \"this side up\" labels, and anti-slip feet. These cues guide correct setup, but nothing prevents the operator from ignoring them.",
  "level_2_example_2": "A circular saw with blade guard markings and a safety sticker. The warnings are visible, but nothing prevents the operator from removing the guard.",
  "level_3_name": "Safety Assisted",
  "level_3_description": "The device has built-in features that reduce risk automatically, but incorrect technique or accidental misuse can still result in harm.",
  "level_3_example_1": "A power drill with electronic brake, torque limiter, and insulated casing. These features reduce injury risk, but the operator can still slip or drill into something they shouldn't.",
  "level_3_example_2": "A car with seatbelts and airbags. The safety systems help significantly in a crash, but reckless driving can still cause serious harm.",
  "level_3_example_3": "An assisted-braking belay device, whether passive or active. The device helps catch a fall automatically, but incorrect technique can still cause the rope to slip through.",
  "level_4_name": "Fail-Safe",
  "level_4_description": "The device forces a safe state that cannot be overridden by the operator. No amount of incorrect technique, inattention, or misuse can bypass the protection during normal operation.",
  "level_4_example_1": "A microwave oven with redundant door interlocks. The magnetron physically cannot energise unless all switches confirm the door is sealed. The operator cannot run the microwave with the door open.",
  "level_4_example_2": "A lift with door interlocks and slack-rope brakes. The car cannot move unless the doors are closed, and it will stop automatically if the cable fails.",
  "level_4_example_3": "A climbing gym auto-belay. The device automatically takes up slack and arrests falls mechanically. The climber cannot override the braking system during normal use.",
  "level_5_name": "Inherently Safe",
  "level_5_description": "The danger is designed out entirely. The device simply cannot cause serious harm through normal use.",
  "level_5_example_1": "A plastic letter opener instead of a metal blade. It can open envelopes but cannot cut skin.",
  "level_5_example_2": "A battery-powered desk fan instead of a mains-powered one. The low voltage cannot deliver a dangerous shock.",
